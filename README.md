# A big Change Incoming :) tRPC will replace restful API.

### But for now, Restful API will still be around because it is still relevant and I still want to create a complete application in restful API in a meaningful way

This will be a big change since my codes are heavily depends on each other :( still I want to create something even more powerful. So something like tRPC will suit my needs, of course I will use socket.io to create even more real-time features for this application. This app will be big :) I will make this one of my creation, still It has a very long way to go. Hope it can help you learn more, even though my codes are not the best, as I can say my codes are messy :) Welp better get good then.
